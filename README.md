A game created by Cocos Creator 1.7.0

## Env setup
Plan is using pure java script so native development is no necessary.
* Install Cocos Create 1.7.0 from official website. Restrict version 1.7.0 here in case compatiable is not runing good.
* Install js source editor. Microsoft Stuido Code is suggested. Why need source editor? Cause bundled editor does not work well; if you double click on .js files and it just displayed compile error and won't open editor for you!

## Known bugs of CocosCreator 1.7.0
* Double click on js source would show you js compile error;
* Startup program of CocosCreator shows 'invalid command'.
